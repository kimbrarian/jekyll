                    <p>Hi. My name is Kim Vassiliadis. I am passionate about creating intuitive web experiences that work for their intended audiences. 
                        I have over fifteen years of experience designing and managing websites within higher education.</p>
                   
                    <p> A good website is more than just a pretty design. It requires a content strategy and user research. I have extensive experience 
                       creating in-person and web-based usability testing, content audits, survey design and facilitating focus groups.
                        My user experience background stems from working in libraries and their rich digital collections. 
                       I focused on making the library’s physical spaces and disparate online systems appear seamless and easy for 
                       researchers to navigate.</p>
                        
                        
                       <p>I am currently the manager of Digital Services, a department within The University of North Carolina’s Campus IT 
                       division. Digital  Services is responsible for the management and maintenance of Carolina’s 12,000+ site WordPress 
                       Multisite. I work with departments and schools from across campus and help them design or redesign their websites. While 
                       no two websites are alike, all clients want to produce usable websites that communicate useful information to 
                       their end users. I have the privilege of helping to determine what that means for each client.
                    </p>
