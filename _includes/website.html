                <p>I work with WordPress everyday. I love WordPress, but I wanted to try something different - a little more lightweight. 
                    I wanted a website that didn’t require a lot of upkeep. This site was created with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a 
                    website generator that’s designed for building minimal, static websites or blogs  that can be hosted on GitHub Pages. 
                    This means, no database, no CMS, secure (well, more secure than a lot of WP sites since it is so stripped down), and 
                    super fast. 

<p>This is my first attempt at working with Jekyll. I read some documentation, picked an attractive 
                    <a href="http://jekyll.tips/templates/">bootstrap template</a> and just went from there.  
    It is fun to play with markup again. </p></div>
